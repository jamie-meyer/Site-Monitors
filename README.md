# Site-Monitors

## Background
The two scripts are monitors that check for the release of new products. For one, the uber eats monitors checks whether Birthday Cakes & Blackberries had been released by the Salt & Straw ice cream store in the Arts District. The other checks for new items added to the Marine Layer clothing store. Both have a pretty similar structure, and I recommend using this structure for these type of scripts because of it's modularity and ease-of-use. I don't run these anymore, so it's possible they don't work, but I do run monitors for multiple baseball card shops and other things for my brother and myself.
